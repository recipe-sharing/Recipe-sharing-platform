# Recipe Sharing Platform
The web app allows you to register, log in with your user. After logging in as a regular user, you have the ability to view various pre-created categories, such as Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, etc.

Only an ADMIN creates categories, while the user can publish recipes based on those categories (currently in development).

It is not possible for an ADMIN to be registered from an API endpoint, or registration form in the frontend. This has to be manually set in the database.

## How to run the app
### Prerequisites
- JDK 17
- Node 20
- H2 database
